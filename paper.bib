	conference = {International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media},
	year = {2018},
	keywords = {Political Trolls,Online Communities,Reddit,The_Donald,Trolling,Collective Action},
	abstract = {Political trolls initiate online discord not only for the lulz  (laughs), but also for ideological reasons, such as promoting  their desired political candidates. Political troll groups  recently gained spotlight because they were considered central  in helping Donald Trump win the 2016 US presidential  election, which involved difficult mass mobilizations. Political  trolls face unique challenges as they must build their own  communities while simultaneously disrupting others. However,  little is known about how political trolls mobilize sufficient  participation to suddenly become problems for others.  We performed a quantitative longitudinal analysis of more  than 16 million comments from one of the most popular  and disruptive political trolling communities, the subreddit  /r/The Donald (T_D). We use T_D as a lens to understand  participation and collective action within these deviant  spaces. In specific, we first study the characteristics of the  most active participants to uncover what might drive their  sustained participation. Next, we investigate how these active  individuals mobilize their community to action. Through our  analysis we uncover that the most active employed distinct  discursive strategies to mobilize participation, and deployed  technical tools like bots to create a shared identity and sustain  engagement. We conclude by providing data-backed design  implications for designers of civic media.},
